Put simply, velocity is the speed at which something moves in one direction. The speed of a car traveling north on a major freeway and the speed a rocket launching into space can both be measured using velocity.\r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed, the scalar (absolute value) magnitude of the velocity vector is the speed of motion. In calculus terms, velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time. You can calculate velocity by using a simple formula that includes rate, distance, and time.\r\n', 'about-bg.jpg', '2020-07-08 12:47:06'),

Be careful not to confuse these values with each other.\r\n\r\n    Speed, according to its technical definition, is a scalar quantity that indicates the rate of motion distance per time. Its units are length and time. Put another way, speed is a measure of distance traveled over a certain amount of time. Speed is often described simply as the distance traveled per unit of time. It is how fast an object is moving. \r\n    Velocity is a vector quantity that indicates displacement, time, and direction. Unlike speed, velocity measures displacement, a vector quantity indicating the difference between an object\'s final and initial positions. Speed measures distance, a scalar quantity that measures the total length of an object\'s path.\r\n    Acceleration is defined as a vector quantity that indicates the rate of change of velocity. It has dimensions of length and time over time. Acceleration is often referred to as \"speeding up\", but it really measures changes in velocity. Acceleration can be experienced every day in a vehicle. You step on the accelerator and the car speeds up, increasing its velocity.', 'about-bg.jpg', '2020-07-08 12:48:02'),

In this case, two equations should be used to solve the problem: one to find the height of the building or distance the egg travels and one to find final velocity.\r\n\r\nStart with the following equation for distance to find out how tall the building was:\r\n', 'about-bg.jpg', '2020-07-08 12:49:16'),

The calculation of a new position was known as dead reckoning. In addition to errors in the compass and in the log, dead reckoning suffered from errors due to the drift of the water. When ocean currents were first marked on charts of the open sea and when tidal streams appeared on coastal charts, navigators could make allowance for drift. Fortunately, the currents were seldom fast and, on long voyages, often tended to cancel each other out.', 'about-bg.jpg', '2020-07-08 12:50:54'),
